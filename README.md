Single-Cell RNA Sequencing and Gene Ontology Analysis of Neutrophils in Asthmatic and Obese Asthmatic Mice Treated with GLP-1 Agonist in R

The experiment involved studying mice from two groups: The control group was asthmatic mice and the experimental group was obese asthmatic mice injected with a GLP-1 agonist. After harvesting the tissues, flow cytometry was performed on them. We wanted to see how the Neutrophils differed in a metabolically dysregulated environment. Then, we did single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis using the Seurat package in R. The process included data normalization and scaling, identification of variable features, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization of the results. We specifically observed the neutrophils and epithelial cells across both the control and experimental groups, identifying the clusters by running feature plots with cell-specific markers. A significant focus is placed on gene ontology analysis to interpret the biological significance of the identified clusters. The results offer insights into the diverse biological processes and cellular function and give ample opportunity for continued research. This is important because understanding these processes can help us for basic biology knowledge and also for developing better and more specific drugs and treatments for obesity and asthma.
